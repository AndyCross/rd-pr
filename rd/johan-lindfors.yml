  ## Bio
  I've been working with Windows and Windows Phone since the early days and I'm
  often speaking about the platform and technologies at various events. In the
  middle of 2011 I founded the company Coderox, currently entirely focused on
  Microsoft platform with various customers and engagements, some leveraging
  XAML and C#, others using C++ and DirectX. Before Coderox, I worked at
  Microsoft for almost 13 years, and have also been the head of development at
  Infozone.
  
  I've also been nominated and accepted into the Microsoft Regional Director
  program thanks to my experience in cross platform client development and prior
  customer and speaking engagements.
  
  Talk to me about: Universal Windows Platform, C++, C#, XAML, Mixed Reality and
  Game Development
tagline: Windows Client / Gaming Technologies
