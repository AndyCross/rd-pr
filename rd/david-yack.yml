  ## Spotlight
  Challenge yourself to innovate! It’s tempting to keep doing what you’ve always
  done and not learn the latest technology, especially considering the rapid
  pace of technology changes today. But that can be a problem when you start
  falling behind your peers who are investing in learning new technologies. One
  day you will look up and realize you aren’t a good fit for any of the new
  project skill demands. You can’t learn everything that is newly released; you
  must focus on one or two new technologies to invest in.
  
  I’ve had a lot of fun helping others do this by leading innovation challenge
  days at one of the popular Dynamics 365 conferences. We start the day by
  brainstorming ideas and then form teams. This is where the magic happens. Two
  recent teams used the Bot Framework and IoT with Connected Field Service. In
  both examples, the teams left with hands-on experience and a good
  understanding of what each of the technologies can do. So even setting aside a
  single day can make a difference and if you get a chance to do it with a team
  it can be even more rewarding!
