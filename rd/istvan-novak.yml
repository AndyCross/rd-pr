  ## Bio
  I am a principal and the chief technology consultant of SoftwArt, a small
  Hungarian IT consulting company. Most of my time I train and coach teams for
  agile software development and teach them how to use modern tools and
  practices.
  
  My specialty is managing small and productive teams using Microsoft related
  technologies to create and maintain their software product.
  
  Besides mentoring university students and young software engineers, I write
  and publish web development books.
  
  I am a recognized expert in .NET, Visual Studio, and related technologies
  (Microsoft Most Valuable Professional). I had already been a Microsoft
  Regional Director between since 2011 and 2015, and I was awarded this title in
  2017 again.
  
  My life would not be full without my wonderful wife and beautiful daughters. I
  am a rabid fan of long distance running and scuba diving.
  
  Talk me about: Scrum, agile values, agile architecture, C#, Visual Studio,
  VSX, VS Code, application life cycle management.
