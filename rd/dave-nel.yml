  ## Bio
  In 2010, along with my close friend, Ian Roberts, I started Tangent Solutions.
  A cloud first, digital solutions consulting house that focuses on digital
  transformation.
  
  I love mobile and cloud. I'm proficient on iOS and Android, Xamarin Forms,
  Xamarin Native and true Native. I've done my time on HTML hybrids, and hope
  not to do it again. Azure is king in my world and I have deployed a number of
  workloads onto PaaS as well as Linux IaaS. Right now I'm quite excited about
  using Kubernetes in Azure for our microservices framework, Nimble and the
  upcoming release of Linux App Services on Azure.
  
  I enjoy working with developer communities and am involved with a couple of
  User Groups. Currently I'm a co-organizer for the Azure User Group in
  Johannesburg as well as the Durban Xamarin User Group, giving me an excuse to
  head to the coast once a month.
  
  I'm very passionate about digital transformation. But digital transformation
  done right. This means targeted MVPs with a DevOps delivery. This approach
  allows for a improved build quality, reduced costs and most importantly, a
  quicker time to market.
  
  Throughtout my career I've gained broad exposure to Information Technology
  across South Africa doing work for SMEs, mid-size corporates and large scale
  enterprises including amongst others, the JSE, Investec, Standard Bank,
  Vodacom, Sun International and Liberty Life.
  
  I have my Masters in Information Technology and Philosophy and thoroughly
  enjoy a good debate.
  
  I've spoken at a number of events in South Africa and internationally about Digital
  Transformation, the power of the Cloud, Bots and the Azure Bot Framework, Xamarin and mobile DevOps.
  
  Talk to me about Cloud Modernization, Azure, Bots, Xamarin, Microsoft and Open
  Source.
